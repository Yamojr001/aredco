People who have earned their stillness.\n\nThis estate exists for those who are at a stage where rest is no longer a luxury — it is a right. Whether it is a place to retreat and gather strength for the next chapter, or a place to settle after a long and meaningful career, the Regency Villas offer a home designed for renewal.\n\nHere, the world slows. The air clears. The mind unclutters.\n\nThis is where you come to breathe, to reflect, and to live on your own terms.`
